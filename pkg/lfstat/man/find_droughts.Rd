\title{Identifying Low Flow Periods}
\description{
A streamflow deficit is defined as an event where discharges are below a given threshold.
}
\usage{
find_droughts(x, threshold = vary_threshold, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
an object which can be coerced to class xts. Either with a single column or with a column named 'discharge'. Units of x are retrieved from the attributes. If it fails, an error is raised.
}
  \item{threshold}{The threshold can either be a constant value, a time series as long as \code{x} or a function (taking a single argument) returning either of these. E.g. \code{\link{vary_threshold}} for varying a threshold in time.}
  \item{\dots}{
if threshold is a function, these additional arguments are passed on to the function
}
}

\value{
an object of class 'deficit', which is basically an xts object with the columns
\item{discharge}{discharges as provided with \code{x}}
\item{threshold}{the threshold}
\item{def.increase}{The increase of the deficit volume in m^3 per day. }
\item{event.no}{an event id. If an event is numbered "0" this period not considered as a streamflow deficit.}
}

There are summary and plot methods, see \code{\link{summary.deficit}} and \code{\link{plot.deficit}}.

data(ray)
r <- find_droughts(ray)
head(r)
summary(r)
plot(r)

# threshold is to low, because there are many days with
# zero flow observations
# provide threshold as a constant value
r <- find_droughts(ray, threshold = 0.02)
head(r)
summary(r)
plot(r)


# provide threshold as a function

                   threshold = function(x) quantile(x, 0.2, na.rm = TRUE))
