\title{
Base Flow Index
}
\description{
Calculates the base flow index of an object of class 'lfobj'.
}
\usage{
BFI(lfobj, year = "any",breakdays = NULL, yearly = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{lfobj}{An object of class "lfobj"
}
  \item{year}{
The year for which the BFI should be computed. If hyearstart != 1 the BFI is calculated for the hydrological year! "any" means the whole series should be taken.
}
  \item{breakdays}{
A vector of breakdays if the BFI should be calculated for different seasons. 
}
  \item{yearly}{
If TRUE,  the BFI is calculated for each hydrological year separately. 
}
}
\details{
If breakdays is a single day, e.g. "01/06", the start of the hydrological year is taken as the second breakday. If more than two seasons are to be specified, a vector of all breakdays is needed.
}

\value{
A length one vector giving the BFI for the whole series or the specified
year. If yearly is true, a vector of the annual BFIs is returned. If
breakdays are specified, the values are separated per season.
