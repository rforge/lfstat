\description{
Calculates the quantiles of an object of class 'lfobj'.
}
\usage{
Qxx(lfobj, Qxx, year = "any", monthly = FALSE, yearly = FALSE,
breakdays = NULL, na.rm = TRUE)

Q95(lfobj, year = "any", monthly = FALSE, yearly = FALSE,
breakdays = NULL, na.rm = TRUE)

Q90(lfobj, year = "any", monthly = FALSE, yearly = FALSE,
breakdays = NULL, na.rm = TRUE)

breakdays = NULL, na.rm = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{lfobj}{An object of class "lfobj"
  }
  \item{Qxx}{The quantile to calculate, e.g. 70 would refer to Q70}
  \item{year}{
The year for which the Q95 should be computed. If hyearstart != 1 the Q95 is calculated for the hydrological year! "any" means the whole series should be taken.
}
  \item{monthly}{
logical - Should the Q95 be calculated separately for every month?. 
}
  \item{yearly}{
logical - If TRUE,  the Q95 is calculated for each hydrological year separately. 
} 
 \item{breakdays}{
A vector of breakdays if the Q95 should be calculated for different seasons. 
}
\item{na.rm}{Should NA's be ignored?}
}
\details{
If breakdays is a single day, e.g. "01/06", the start of the hydrological year is taken as the second breakday. If more than two seasons are to be specified, a vector of all breakdays is needed.
}

\value{
A length one vector giving the Q95 for the whole series or the specified
year. If yearly is true, a vector of the annual Q95s is returned. If
breakdays are specified, the values are separated per season.
