# lfstat 0.9.0


## New Functionality

* new function ``apply.seasonal()``, eg for computing seasonal extreme values

* drought summaries now report the days below threshold (dbt), the minimum discharge (qmin) as well as the date of the minimum discharge (tqmin)

* Support for vardat2 file format: ``read.vardat2()``

* new function ``fill_na()`` for interpolating short gaps in a time series

* discharge units of a time series can be set and retrieved with ``flowunit()``





## Changes

* bugfixes in ``summary.deficit()``

* being more relaxed when converting an lfobj to xts via ``as.xts.lfobj()``. If there is no unit stored in the attributes "m^3/s" is assumed and a warning is given.
